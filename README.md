Stopwatch Web application

I created a stopwatch web application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. Users can accurately measure and record time intervals by implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch and tracking and displaying lap times. I created an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application with these technologies and functionalities.
